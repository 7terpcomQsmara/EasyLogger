Network security focuses on the cryptographic algorithms and protocols that are used to protect data in transit and at rest. The book covers symmetric-key encryption, public-key encryption, hash functions, digital signatures, key management, and authentication protocols. It also discusses the vulnerabilities and attacks on popular non-cryptographic network protocols, such as TCP/IP, DNS, ARP, DHCP, and SNMP.
 
System security deals with the defense mechanisms that are implemented at the operating system level and the network level. The book covers malware detection and prevention, access control models and policies, firewalls, VPNs, network-level access control, and intrusion detection systems. It also explains how to perform security audits and assessments, and how to comply with legal and ethical issues in computer security.
 
Application security covers the security aspects of various software applications and services that are used online. The book covers web security, email security, e-commerce security, cloud computing security, mobile security, social network security, and next-generation web services. It also explores the emerging topics of quantum cryptography, biometric security, blockchain technology, and artificial intelligence in computer security.
 
*Network Security and Cryptography* is a comprehensive and accessible book that covers both the theoretical foundations and the practical applications of computer security. It is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, information technology, engineering, and related disciplines. It is also a valuable reference for professionals and practitioners who want to learn about the latest developments and challenges in computer security.
  
The book is divided into 23 chapters, each covering a specific topic in computer security. Each chapter begins with a set of learning objectives and ends with a summary, review questions, and exercises. The book also includes numerous examples, figures, tables, and diagrams to illustrate the concepts and techniques. The book also provides references to additional resources and websites for further reading and exploration.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise style, with an emphasis on both theory and practice. The book assumes that the reader has a basic background in computer science, mathematics, and networking. The book is suitable for both self-study and classroom use. The book can also be used as a reference for professionals and practitioners who want to update their knowledge and skills in computer security.
